# Wine Quality Data Set Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, I will be analyzing the Wine Quality dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

I will be exploring white wine data , red wine data and then I will be combining the data to compare red & white wine. I will try to answer the following questions:Â¶

Which type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?

What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?

Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?

Do sweeter wines receive better ratings?

What is proportion of the quality ratings for each wine type?
